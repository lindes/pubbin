# a simple command to see if README is actually listing everything we
# have here.  Not considered part of the main software, just something
# to help me make sure I keep everything documented.

# compare listing of all executables with extraction of command names
# from list in README.md:
diff -u <(/bin/ls -1 *(*)) \
        <(grep '^\* `' README.md | sed -e 's/^...//' -e 's/`.*//')
