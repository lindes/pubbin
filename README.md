lindes's pubbin
===============

Public 'bin' directory, for commands I think others would find useful.

I'll gradually migrate things from my personal private `$HOME/bin`
into this repository.  You're encouraged to check it out as
`$HOME/lindes-bin` or similar, and then puth that into your `$PATH`,
if you think you'll find these tools generally useful.  Or pick and
choose as you see fit.

Pull requests, bug reports, and more are welcome, using
[github](https://github.com/lindes/pubbin).

## Current contents:

* `git-initremote` - initialize a remote git repository (useful for
  when you're creating a new repo to push to - creates a bare repo
  according to a remote-spec already added with `git remote add ...`.)
